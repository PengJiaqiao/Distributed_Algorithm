# Distributed_Algorithm
## Introduction
The lecture provides an overview of conceptual problems occurring in distributed systems and deals with their algorithmic possibilities of solution.

The students are going to  
● get to know the most important basic distributed algorithms  
● develop an understanding of the structure of distributed algorithms, their complexity, their scalability and their fault tolerance features,  
● choose convenient distributed algorithms while drafting distributed systems  
● understand the possibilities, limits and risks of distributed systems.
